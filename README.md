description: Creating and distributing apps for elementary OS

# Getting Started

## What is \(and Isn't\) Covered

No experience in writing apps for elementary OS is assumed, but basic programming knowledge is.
A little experience, prior [knowledge of Vala](https://valadoc.org/) (or at least similarly syntaxed languages) is valuable.

Design is covered in [Human Interface Guidelines \(HIG\)](https://docs.elementary.io/hig/).
By adhering to it you can match the great design and stellar consistency of elementary OS.

## Writing Apps

This book details
building apps using GTK, Granite, and other technology available in elementary OS,
setting up a build system,
hosting your code for collaborative development,
working with translations,
a few other bits and pieces,
and finally packaging and distributing your new app.

Skip ahead and start writing your first app if confident enough to jump straight into coding,
but do skim through the preparation step first.
Having the right setup helps in reaching your goals faster,
and a solid foundation comes in handy throughout the rest of this book.

## AppCenter Publishing Requirements

Correct metadata, legal specificaion, and other technical aspects are required to publish your app to users on AppCenter.
